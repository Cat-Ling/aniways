## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Coeeter/aniways.git
```

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the dev server
bun dev
```

NOTE: You will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```properties
# MyAnimeList API
MAL_CLIENT_ID=<mal-client-id>
MAL_CLIENT_SECRET=<mal-client-secret>

# JWT Secret for MAL Authentication
MAL_SECRET_KEY=<mal-secret-key>

# Postgres Database Connection String
DATABASE_URL=<postgres-database-url>
```

To get the `MAL_CLIENT_ID` and `MAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, you will need to create a new application on the [MyAnimeList API](https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig).

To get the `MAL_SECRET_KEY`, you can generate a random string using a tool like [randomkeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/).

To get the `DATABASE_URL`, you will need to create a new postgres database and get the connection string.
