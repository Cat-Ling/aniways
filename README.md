- üîç Search and browse anime
- üì∫ Stream in HD with subtitle support
- üåê Switch between multiple servers for reliability
- üìå Track viewing progress
- üìù Maintain a personal watchlist
- üîó Integrate with external services (like MyAnimeList)

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

### üîß Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (for running proxy manually)
- [Java 17+](https://adoptium.net/) (for running Ktor API manually)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Start (Docker)

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Coeeter/aniways.git
cd aniways
```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your preferred values.

3. **Run the App**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Start the API on `http://localhost:8080`
- Start the HLS proxy on `http://localhost:1234`
- Start the frontend on `http://localhost:5173`

## üß™ Running Without Docker

### üî∏ API (Ktor)

```bash
cd api
ENV_FILE=../.env ./gradlew run
```

> Make sure you have Java 17+ installed.

### üî∏ Streaming Proxy (Bun)

```bash
cd streaming
NODE_ENV=development bun src/index.ts
```

> Make sure Bun is installed. This assumes your config is loaded based on `NODE_ENV`.

### üî∏ Frontend (SvelteKit)

```bash
cd website
bun install     # or npm install
bun run dev     # or npm run dev
```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment (Free Options)

### üîπ **Frontend (SvelteKit)**

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

These platforms can deploy your `website/` directory directly. You‚Äôll need to expose your API/proxy URLs via environment variables.

### üîπ **Backend (API + Streaming)**

- [Railway](https://railway.app/)
- [Render](https://render.com/)
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) _(for basic experimentation)_

> These can deploy your `api/` and `streaming/` services individually by pointing to their Dockerfiles or using a `Docker Compose` file on platforms that support it.

## üåç Environment Variables

Refer to `.env.example` for the required environment variables across:

- `api` (Ktor)
- `streaming` (HLS Proxy)
- `website` (Frontend)

Make sure to configure CORS, API base URLs, and streaming paths appropriately depending on environment (`NODE_ENV` / `ENV_FILE`).
